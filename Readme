Ecole Centrale Lyon ask students to produce their internship reports using given templates.

Unfortunately, the school didn't provide a LaTeX template, so here is one. This project is aimed at keeping it up to date and making it better. Everyone can contribute.

If you want to contribute, describe an issue in the "Issues" tab, and attach some code to solve it.
